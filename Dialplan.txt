Current dialplan flags and arguments used by app_conference
Please note that app_conference is still work in progress, so this document might be outdated. As always, the source code is the definitive reference (member.c in create_member())

The general syntax of Appconference dialplan entries is:

exten => <ext>,<pri>,Conference(<confname>/<flags>/<optional args>/<more optional args>)

The optional arguments have the format <arg>=<value> and should be separated by slashes(/)

1. Flags

Mute/no receive options:
'C' : member starts with video muted
'c' : member starts unable to receive video
'L' : member starts with audio muted
'l' : member starts unable to receive audio

Speex preprocessing options (right now app_conference does preprocessing only for Zaptel members):
'V' : enable speex preprocessing Voice Activity Detection 
'D' : enable speex preprocessing De-noise
'A' : enable speex preprocessing Automatic Gain Control
'T' : member connects through Zaptel, so speex preprocessing should be enabled

DTMF options:
'X' : enable DTMF switch: video can be switched by users using DTMF. Do not use with 'S'.
'R' : enable DTMF relay: DTMF tones generate a manager event
If neither 'X' nor 'R' are present, DTMF tones will be forwarded to all members in the conference

Moderator/video switch options:
'M' : member is a "moderator". When a moderator quits, all members are kicked and the conference is disabled.
'S' : member accepts VAD controlled video switching.  Do not use with 'X'.
'z' : member can "linger". When the member is currently transmitting video and becomes silent and nobody else is speaking, we stay on it.
'o' : enable special behavior when in 1 and 2 member situation (one on one video). The conference observes the 'o' status of the last 
      member to join it
'F' : force switch mode: if the member is talking, force a switch to it even when there is no video

Miscellaneous:
't' : member accepts text based control messages.  The messages are described in a separate document
'N' : Assume that the member starts off with camera disabled.

Future development (these are not implemented yet):
'x' : marked member.  We plan to change the behavior so that when ALL moderators quit, all members that are marked will get kicked. Other members in the conference are not affected.

2. Arguments

The parser is not perfect so it might not cope well with spurious spaces or other characters.
All arguments are optional; appconference will use sane default values for missing arguments.

priority=<int> : This argument is currently unused, it was intended to allow for prioritization of speakers.  It might be reinstated in a future appconference revision
vad_prob_start=<float> : Probability used to detect start of speech
vad_prob_continue=<float> : Probability to detect continuation of speech
video_start_timeout=<int> : Length of speech (in ms) before we say that a member is speaking (for video switching purposes)
video_stop_timeout=<int>  : Length of silence (in ms) before we say that a member has stopped speaking (for video switching purposes)

3. Examples

exten => 6969,1,Conference(testconf/SNt)

Calling extension 6969 will connect to conference "testconf". The member accepts VAD based video switching, knows about
the text based control protocol and is assumed to start off with camera disabled


exten => 6969,1,Conference(testconf/SNt/video_start_timeout=1000/video_stop_timeout=1000)

Same as above, but the timeouts used for VAD based video switching are set to 1000 ms (from the default of 2000 ms).
The effect is faster video switching.

exten => 6969,1,Conference(testconf/XNt)

Same as the first example, but video switching is now controlled by clients via DTMF
